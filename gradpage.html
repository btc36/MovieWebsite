            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ben Cookson. I am a graduate student at BYU studying computer science. I am currently working as a web developer at the BYU Store. I have a passion for coding and enjoy learning new technologies.</p>
            <h3>Where did I come from?</h3>
            <p>I was born and raised in Orem and have loved computers since I was young. My dad is a computer programmer and I have followed in his footsteps</p>
            <h3>Why am I here?</h3>
            <p>I have been at BYU for a very long time and seem to come back for more school every time I leave. I have worked as a web developer for almost 8 years now and continue to learn each day.</p>
            <h3>Where am I going?</h3>
            <p>I am currently working on my PhD in computer science. I am working with the Computer Graphics Department and plan to reasearch something that can improve computer animation</p>
            <p>I love watching movies and I would love to create something that can improve the process and make them more realistic and efficient</p>
            <p>When I graduate I could go on to become a professor or search for a job in some leadership position. I have not decided what I want to do yet.</p>

                    <p class="job-description">
                        While employed at Continuing Education, I was an integral part of a development team tasked with updating, improving, and maintaining the software crucial for the company's operations. This program played a vital role in managing and running various events such as EFY and FSY conferences, sports camps, and online high school activities.
    My role involved working with JavaScript and Coldfusion, encompassing a wide range of tasks from rectifying small lexical errors to creating brand new features and additions for the website. This experience allowed me to cultivate valuable skills, including effective teamwork, navigating updates within large legacy code, and designing and implementing new features to meet customer criteria.

                        I currently hold the position of lead web developer at the store. I worked in the store as an undergrad for 2 years, and now I work full time. Our accounting software, NetSuite, is a key tool in our operations. My responsibilities involve writing customizations for internal employee use and developing outward-facing applications. Additionally, I create separate apps that seamlessly connect with NetSuite.
    Noteworthy recent projects include constructing a Self Checkout System for the store, developing an app to oversee and manage all warehouse functions (including organizing, fulfilling, billing, and shipping online orders), and building an application to facilitate the management and implementation of our store's partnership with the church in providing missionary nametags. Furthermore, I am actively involved in customizing and maintaining byustore.com, the platform for all online purchases.
    As the only full time developer in my job, I assume various responsibilities throughout the development process. Collaborating closely with the head of IT, I am involved in designing, developing, coding, testing, deploying, training, and providing support for all IT-related projects within the store.
    I have also had the opportunity to supervise and teach student employees. I have helped them learn how to code in NetSuite, reviewed their code, and taught them good coding practices.
